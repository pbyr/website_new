**European Union Sectoral Emissions Data (EUSED)**
 
EUSED provides CO2 emissions for 33 countries (EU ETS member countries plus Switzerland and Turkey), disaggregated into 7 sectors which are matched between UNFCCC sectors (CRF) and EU ETS activities, 1990-2016. The data is available from [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/eused) or can be downloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2luxhoyt9u4r8q4/EUSED.zip?dl=0). Please read the [codebook](https://www.dropbox.com/s/y090l11fdq7zgq1/EUSED_codebook.pdf?dl=0) before using the data.
