## Welcome

I am Professor of Political Economy and Research Director of the Division in [Political and International Studies](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/socialpolitical/research/political-international-studies-research/) in the [School of Social and Political Sciences](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/socialpolitical/) at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/). I am affiliated with the Global Sustainable Development theme at Glasgow's [Advanced Research Centre](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/arc/) (ARC) and the [Climate Social Science Network (CSSN)](https://cssn.org/) at Brown University. I serve as a Steering Group Member of the [Environmental Politics and Governance](https://epgnetwork.org/) (EPG) network and was Conference Chair for [EPG's 9th Annual Conference](https://epgnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-Glasgow-EPG-Programme.pdf) in Glasgow in 2023. I was recently appointed as Associate Deputy Editor for the journal [Climatic Change](https://link.springer.com/journal/10584).

My research focuses on international cooperation and the political economy of environmental regulation and climate politics. I am particularly interested in how the domestic and international political economy together with political incentives shape *governments'*, *firms'*, and *individuals'* responses to climate change and the global energy transition. Currently, I study the politics of carbon markets, firms' commitments to corporate decarbonisation, and the distributional effects of climate policy. I also lead an [ESRC-funded project](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=ES%2FW001373%2F2) on the role of science in international climate cooperation.

I received the *Emerging Young Scholar Award* of APSA's [Science, Technology and Environmental Policy (STEP)](https://connect.apsanet.org/s15/step-awards-2/) section in 2021 and successfully obtained funding from the British Academy, the Carnegie Trust, and the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC). Among other outlets, my work was published in the *Journal of Politics*, the *Journal of Conflict Resolution*, *Energy Economics*, *PNAS*, *Science Advances* and with MIT Press. My teaching involves classes on international organizations and global climate politics.
