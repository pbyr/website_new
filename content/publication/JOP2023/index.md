abstract: A central claim in the environmental regulation literature is that, in a globalized world economy, governments are willing to offer favorable regulation to firms that threaten to move their operations abroad. This logic, however, overlooks that firms' relocation threats are not equally credible. Focusing on variation in ownership structure, I argue that, even among generally mobile multinational corporations (MNCs), their foreign operations are more credibly movable, and hence more favorably regulated, than their operations at home.
