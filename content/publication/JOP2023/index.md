# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "A central claim in the environmental regulation literature is that, in a globalized world economy, governments are willing to offer favorable regulation to firms that threaten to move their operations abroad. This logic, however, overlooks that firmsâ€™ relocation threats are not equally credible. Focusing on variation in ownership structure, I argue that, even among generally mobile multinational corporations (MNCs), their foreign operations are more credibly movable, and hence more favorably regulated, than their operations at home. MNCsâ€™ country-specific investments into the economy and politics of their home markets drive this difference in relative mobility. An empirical analysis that relies on within-firm variation in ownership of MNCsâ€™ production sites across European countries and original plant-level carbon regulation data strongly support my argument: foreign ownership becomes an asset for favorable regulation. These findings highlight the need to account for mobility differences among MNCs."
